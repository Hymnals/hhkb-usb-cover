# HHKB USB Cover

[demo](https://github.com/egladman/hhkb-usb-cover/blob/master/usb_cover.stl)

<br>

This is my first attempt at modeling a cover for each of the unused ports on the Happy Hacking Keyboard while using Hasu's controller.

*I have yet to print this, so don't expect perfection*

Contributions/Suggestions are welcome!
